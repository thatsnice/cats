<h2>Who are these adorable creatures?!</h2>

<p>From left to right, meet:</p>

<h3>Milk Tea</h3>

<ul>
<li>9.9 pounds</li>
<li>4 years old</li>
<li>She's a pretty pretty princess and she knows it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Milk Tea was named by the Humane Society for the pattern on her fur. She is
outgoing, greeting new people as soon as the noise dies down. She prefers to
press her head and back against the petting hand rather than being petted
passively.</p>

<p>In 2022 I had an engagement that kept me away from home for a few months.
Before I left I gave my sister power-of-attorney for me and I started looking
for a cat to keep Jax company while I was away. My friend sent me a link to
Milk Tea's profile on the Humane Society web site, and it was decided. I
picked her up, brought her home, waited for them to get to know each other
through under a door and they have been getting along well every since. They
groom each other. They chase each other around. They play "I'm gonna slap u!"
I prefer not to separate these two.</p>

<h3>Jaxamillion, 'Jax' for short</h3>

<ul>
<li>14.3 pounds</li>
<li>7 years old</li>
<li>He runs Barter Town
<ul>
<li>He's a Taurus</li>
<li>He only speaks to a human when he wants something</li>
<li>He keeps the others in line</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>My first roommate in San Diego brought Jax with her. He had been a stray she
had been feeding in Oceanside. A little over a year later when she was moving
out she brought him out to her RV, but he escaped and ran back to me. She said
he had made his choice.</p>

<p>I had a friend watching Jax and Milk Tea while I was away for a few weeks. She
told me that once when Milk Tea jumped up on my electronic drum kit, she
shooed Milk Tea off. The next time Milk Tea jumped on the kit, Jax shooed her
off. She doesn't jump on the kit any more.</p>

<p>Jax might be a little <em>too</em> smart. But he has only good intentions.</p>

<h3>Whiskey</h3>

<ul>
<li>11.5 pounds</li>
<li>2 years old</li>
<li>He doesn't care how interesting the sounds from the kitchen are, he'll be
staying under this bed until he's sure it's safe.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the summer of 2023 I received a text from a friend who's a bartender. She
said, "You have cats. You need to adopt this cat." There was a stray hiding in
the shade of the bar. The staff were giving him water and food, but he wasn't
looking good. It was routinely over 115F in the shade. We got him into the
carrier I brought, I took him to the Humane Society to get his shots and chip
and he's been with us ever since.</p>

<h2>How do I reach you?</h2>

<p>Contact me via <a href="email:cats@thatsnice.org">cats@thatsnice.org</a>, or
<a href="tel:12069095590">+1 206 909-5590</a>.</p>

<h2>What do they all have in common?</h2>

<p>They all love to chase hair ties. They are very clear: the game is called
"chase", not "fetch." However, I have found piles of hair ties next to my
pillow and computer keyboard that I didn't put there, so I think one of them
(probably Milk Tea) has been trying to get me to play "chase" with them more.</p>

<p>They all prefer a rope-wound post of a cat tree to furniture for nail shedding
purposes. Did you know that this is why cats scratch? They shed their claws
like sharks shed teeth and some other creatures shed shells. They don't
actually hate furniture at all, they just hate their old dull claws and
whatever surface is best at getting them off their new claws will be their
preferred target of apparent aggression.</p>

<p>They all have been eating dry food served by a Feeder-Robot for years. Jax
will tell me if the robot has technical issues or run out of food or
something. I don't know if the others would tell me if Jax didn't already.</p>

<p>They have all been using a Litter-Robot for years. The Litter-Robot app tells
me when it needs service, but Jax reports on this too.</p>

<p>They have all been drinking from a water fountain since I adopted them.</p>

<p>They know their names? If they're all sitting in a room and I say one of
their names, that one will turn and the other two will ignore me.</p>

<h2>Are they fixed? Are they up to date on their shots? Are they chipped?</h2>

<p>They got chipped, fixed and inoculated when I adopted them, but haven't had
any additional shots since then.</p>

<h2>Can I meet them?</h2>

<p>You bet! You can contact me via one of the methods at the top of this page. If
you want to meet them in person, you'll need to come to</p>

<pre><code>830 Holt Ave
Holtville, CA
92250-1222
</code></pre>

<p>You can also meet them online via Google Meet, Discord, FaceTime, or Zoom.</p>

<p>My schedule is busy but flexible.</p>

<h2>I MUST HAVE ONE</h2>

<p>He/she is yours! Call, text or email me!</p>

<h2>I want two of them though</h2>

<p>No problem! We can make this work.</p>

<h2>Actually, I want all three of them</h2>

<p>...</p>

<p>Oh... ok. That's ok too. I just want them to be safe and happy.</p>

<p><em>snif</em></p>

<h2>I might want one... Is there a dowry?</h2>

<p>How did you know?! Yes. Name your price. Tell me how much you need to be able
to afford to take one or more of them on. I will do anything to make sure
these cats are well cared for.</p>

<h2>I'm sorry, I can't. They're very cute, it's just...</h2>

<p>Don't worry, we'll figure something out. These are good cats, I'm sure we'll
find a solution.</p>
